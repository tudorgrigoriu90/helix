# Strand Descent — Task Plan

| Field            | Value                                                |

| Project codename | HELIX                                                |
| Working title    | Strand Descent (locked 2026-05-27)                           |
| Owner            | Tudor Grigoriu / Empathy Software                    |
| Version          | 1.0                                                  |
| Status           | Pre-Production Lock — task source of truth           |
| Created          | 2026-05-27                                           |
| Target tracker   | Atlassian Jira (workspace TBD) — see Open Assumptions |

This is the canonical task list for delivering Strand Descent to soft launch and global launch per the 18-month Path A schedule (GDD §21). It uses the Jira hierarchy **Epic → Story → Task → Sub-task** so it can be imported into Jira (or Azure DevOps with `Story → Feature → Story → Task` re-mapping) when the tracker is provisioned.

When `ai-factory/sa/core/issues-list.md` is the canonical location per the `sa-toolkit:task-plan` skill, this project doesn't use that folder structure (it's a personal indie game, not a Mindit corporate SA engagement). The task list lives at the repo root.

## How to Read This Document

- **Epics (E-N):** long-lived themes that span months. ~13 total.
- **Stories (S-N.M):** functional chunks within an epic. ~75 total.
- **Tasks (T-N):** units of implementation work, sized at 1–5 days of solo+AI work. ~250 total.
- **Sub-tasks (U-N):** added only where a task genuinely benefits from sub-decomposition; not every task has them.

References columns:
- **GDD / TDD / UFD** = section number or screen ID from the consolidated docs
- **NFR** = non-functional requirement, traced to TDD §1 Engineering Principles (P1–P9), §15 Performance Budgets, §17 Security & Privacy

## Role Legend

For a solo+AI team most roles collapse onto the Director plus Claude Code. Roles are kept on tasks so the plan transfers cleanly to a multi-person team if hired:

| Role               | Realised by (this project)                         |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Director           | Tudor Grigoriu (design, content, business decisions) |
| Architect          | Tudor Grigoriu                                     |
| Backend Developer  | Claude Code (TS Cloud Functions, Firestore)        |
| Frontend Developer | Claude Code (Phaser scenes, UI)                    |
| Game Engineer      | Claude Code (turn engine, RNG, sim)                |
| DevOps Engineer    | Claude Code (CI, build, deploy)                    |
| QA Engineer        | Tudor (manual playtest) + Claude Code (automated tests) |

Per-package `tsconfig.json` extends base in `apps/game`, `apps/functions`, `packages/shared-types`. | DevOps | P0 | TDD §2.1 | DONE |
| T-25  | ~~Custom lint rule: forbid Phaser/Capacitor imports in `core/`~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `no-restricted-imports` override in `.eslintrc.json` for `apps/game/src/core/**/*.ts`. Blocks `phaser`, `phaser/*`, and `@capacitor/*` with descriptive error messages referencing TDD §4.1. Verified: lint error fires on any Phaser import in core/. | DevOps           | P0       | TDD §4.1       | DONE |

| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------- | -------------- | ----- |
| T-28  | ~~GitHub Actions workflow: lint + typecheck + Vitest on push to main~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` created. Triggers on push to main + PRs. Steps: pnpm install (frozen-lockfile) → lint → typecheck → test → validate → build:web → build:demo. Fixed blockers: `apps/functions/src/index.ts` placeholder (tsc no-inputs), `@types/node` added to functions, `vitest.config.ts` added to both game + functions (`passWithNoTests: true`). Full sequence verified green locally. | DevOps | P0 | TDD §14.3 | DONE |
| T-29  | ~~Add web build step + Firebase Hosting preview channel per PR~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `deploy` job added to `ci.yml` (`needs: ci`). On PR: `FirebaseExtended/action-hosting-deploy` creates preview channel + posts URL as PR comment. On push to main: deploys to live channel. Project ID: `strand-descent`. Requires `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` secret (set). | DevOps | P0 | TDD §14.3 | DONE |
| T-30  | ~~Add determinism replay test job (100 fixed seeds; assert stable output)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `src/core/rng/determinism-replay.test.ts` created. Two tests: (1) every seed produces identical output on repeated runs; (2) output independent of evaluation order (cross-seed state leak). Dedicated `test:determinism` script + separate `"Determinism replay (100 fixed seeds)"` step in `ci.yml`. Runs 2,000 calls × 5 sub-generators per seed. Both tests pass. **STRENGTHENED 2026-05-28** (Sprint 0 of codebase review): the gate previously fingerprinted only the raw RNG sub-generators, leaving the actual simulation unguarded. Now three tiers over the same 100 fixed seeds — (1) RNG sub-generators; (2) **TurnEngine**: a full headless combat run driven by a fixed state-only policy, fingerprinting the whole trajectory (every action's effects + resulting state), plus an action-log replay asserting the seed + log → identical `RunState` save/resume contract; (3) **FloorGen**: `placeRooms` across all 3 topologies + the Floor 1 template. Each tier asserts repeat-stability, evaluation-order independence, and seed-spread (no vacuous pass). Canonical sorted-key serialisation. 10 tests. Pulls forward the headless-replay portion of T-391. | QA | P0 | TDD §16.2, T4 | DONE |
| T-31  | Add Lighthouse CI gate (>= 85) on web build                    | DevOps   | P1       | TDD §15        | |
| T-32  | Add smoke test: production bundle asserts `DEMO_MODE === false`| DevOps   | P2       | TDD §14.2      | |
| T-33  | Tag-driven workflow: build `.ipa` (macOS runner) + `.aab` (Ubuntu) | DevOps | P2     | TDD §14.3      | fastlane match for iOS certs |
| T-34  | Tag-driven: upload to TestFlight + Play Internal track         | DevOps   | P2       | TDD §14.3      | |

## E-3 — Core Simulation Engine

**Scope:** The deterministic, engine-agnostic TypeScript core. Zero Phaser imports. NFRs P1, P2, P4, P7, P8 all live here.

### S-3.1 — RNG (Mulberry32)

| ID    | Title                                                                 | Role          | Priority | Refs            | Notes |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------- | --------------- | ----- |
| T-52  | ~~Implement `Mulberry32` in `core/rng/mulberry32.ts` (~10 lines)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `Mulberry32` class with `next(): float`, `nextInt(n): int`, serialisable `state` field. Implemented as prerequisite for T-30. | Game Engineer | P0 | TDD §6.1 | DONE |
| T-53  | ~~Sub-generator factory keyed by label (`combat`, `loot`, `floorgen`, `mutationdraw`, `events`)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `makeRng(rootSeed, label)` in `mulberry32.ts`. djb2-variant `hashLabel()` XORs root seed with label hash — adding new labels never shifts existing sub-generators. | Game Engineer | P0 | TDD §6.1 | DONE |
| T-54  | Daily seed: `hash(date_UTC + global_salt)` → 32 bits                  | Game Engineer | P1       | TDD §6.2        | |
| T-55  | Weekly seed: `hash(ISO_week + global_salt)` → 32 bits                 | Game Engineer | P1       | TDD §6.2        | |
| T-56  | ~~Vitest: distribution test (Chi-squared on 1M samples per sub-gen)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `mulberry32.test.ts`. χ²(100 bins, 1M samples) < 148.23 (critical value df=99, α=0.001) for all 5 sub-generators + direct Mulberry32. All pass in ~305ms. Post-commit CI typecheck fix 2026-05-28: added `!` non-null assertion on `counts[idx]!++` to satisfy `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true` in tsconfig.base.json. | QA | P0 | TDD §16.1 | DONE |
| T-57  | ~~Vitest: seed isolation test (changing one sub-gen seed doesn't shift others)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `mulberry32.test.ts`. Three isolation tests: (1) advancing combat 50K steps doesn't shift loot sequence; (2) different labels produce distinct sequences from same root seed; (3) same label + different seeds produce distinct sequences. Plus nextInt bounds check (10K calls). | QA | P0 | TDD §16.1 | DONE |

### S-3.2 — Turn Engine

| ID    | Title                                                                 | Role          | Priority | Refs              | Notes |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| T-58  | ~~`Action` discriminated union in `packages/shared-types`~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `packages/shared-types/src/action.ts` created. Union covers 7 action types: `move` (targetPos), `attack` (targetId), `useAbility` (abilityId + optional targetId/targetPos), `useItem` (itemId + optional targetId), `wait`, `endTurn`, `surrender`. Supporting types: `Position`, `ActionType`. Exported from `index.ts`. All types `readonly`. Typecheck passes. | Game Engineer | P0       | TDD §5.2          | DONE |
| T-59  | ~~`TurnEngine.apply(state, action, rng) → { state, effects, errors }`~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `apps/game/src/core/turn-engine/` created. `RunState` + `PlayerState` + `EnemyState` + `TurnPhase` + `EntityStats` + `StatusEffect` + `ActiveStatus` in `packages/shared-types/src/run-state.ts`. `Effect` (14-variant union) in `effect.ts`. `TurnError` / `TurnErrorCode` in `turn-error.ts`. `TurnEngine.apply` dispatch in `turn-engine.ts`: exhaustive switch over all 7 Action types, each stub validates phase and returns `{ state, effects: [], errors: [] }`. `ok()`/`err()` helpers. Barrel `index.ts`. Also removed `rootDir: "src"` from `apps/game/tsconfig.json` (cross-package path alias imports require it). | Game Engineer | P0       | TDD §5.1          | DONE — NFR P2/P4 |
| T-60  | ~~Move validation + execution~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `applyMove` in `turn-engine.ts` fully implemented per GDD §6.3 (1 AP/tile, 1 tile/action, diagonals allowed). Validates: player phase, in-bounds, Chebyshev distance == 1, target not a wall, target not occupied by a living enemy, sufficient AP. On success: moves player, deducts `MOVE_AP_COST` (1), emits `entityMoved` + `apSpent` effects. Added `GridState`/`TileType` to `RunState` (`packages/shared-types/src/run-state.ts`) — movement needs grid bounds + walls. New `grid.ts` helpers: `inBounds`, `tileAt`, `chebyshev` (reused by attack/floor-gen later). 14 Vitest cases in `turn-engine.move.test.ts` (valid/diagonal/effects/purity/all rejection paths/determinism). Typecheck + lint + build green. | Game Engineer | P0       | TDD §5.3          | DONE |
| T-61  | ~~Attack validation + damage calc (STR/RES, crit, damage type)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `applyAttack` in `turn-engine.ts` (basic melee attack). Validates: player phase, target exists (`TARGET_NOT_FOUND`), target alive, target not `phased` (untargetable), within melee range (Chebyshev ≤ 1), sufficient AP. Damage = `floor(STR × 1.0)`, ×1.5 on crit (applied before mitigation), then flat RES subtraction, clamped `max(0, …)`. Crit roll consumes one `rng.next()` — chance = 5% base + 0.5%/AGI over base (tunable, pending Economy.xlsx). Emits `damageDealt` (`damageType: 'physical'`) + `entityDied` (if HP→0) + `apSpent`. Status application (Stagger) deferred to T-65; accuracy/dodge and ranged-equipment (STR×0.8) deferred. 16 Vitest cases (damage, crit-before-mitigation, no-negative-damage, death, single-target, purity, all rejection paths, determinism). Typecheck + lint + 42 tests green. | Game Engineer | P0       | GDD §6.3-§6.6     | DONE |
| T-62  | ~~Ability targeting + cooldown tracking~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `applyUseAbility` in `turn-engine.ts`. New `AbilityDef`/`AbilitySlot`/`AbilityTargetType` in `packages/shared-types/src/ability.ts` (apCost, cooldown, range, targetType, baseDamage, damageType, intScaling, aoeRadius, appliesStatus, statusDuration). `PlayerState.abilities` now `readonly AbilitySlot[]` (per-ability `cooldownRemaining` lives in RunState → survives save/resume). Targeting modes: `enemy` (single + Chebyshev-radius splash), `tile` (in-bounds, range-checked, AoE), `self` (status to player). Damage = `baseDamage + floor(INT × intScaling)`, mitigated by RES (True ignores it); abilities do **not** crit (crit is a basic-attack mechanic, GDD §6.6) so resolution consumes no RNG. Cooldown set to `def.cooldown` on use; per-turn decrement deferred to turn-flow (T-64/T-66). Suppressed status blocks use. Also added `DamageType` union (GDD §6.4) + tightened `effect.ts` `damageDealt.damageType`/`statusApplied.status` to real unions, and extracted shared `combat.ts` (`mitigate`/`rollCrit`/`applyCrit`), refactoring T-61's attack onto it. New error codes: `ABILITY_NOT_FOUND`, `ABILITY_SUPPRESSED`. 20 Vitest cases (INT scaling, true damage, cooldown set+block, status apply, no-status-on-kill, self-buff, tile + enemy AoE, all rejection paths, purity, determinism). Typecheck + lint + 62 tests + build green. | Game Engineer | P0       | GDD §6.3          | DONE |
| T-63  | ~~Item use resolution~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `applyUseItem` in `turn-engine.ts` resolves consumables (single-use, 1 AP, no cooldown — GDD §9.2). New `ItemDef`/`ItemCategory`/`ItemEffect` in `packages/shared-types/src/item.ts`; `PlayerState.items` now `readonly ItemDef[]`. `ItemEffect` union: `heal` (self, clamped to maxHp, reports actual healed), `damage` (tile-targeted Chebyshev AoE, RES-mitigated, True ignores RES), `applyStatus` (tile-targeted AoE). Validates phase, item in inventory (`ITEM_NOT_FOUND`), is consumable (`ITEM_NOT_CONSUMABLE`), AP, and tile target in-bounds for grenades. Consumes exactly one instance on success; emits `itemUsed` → effect-specific → `apSpent`. RNG-free (items don't crit). Added `targetPos?` to `UseItemAction` (matches TDD §5.2 `target?: Tile`). AoE shapes (2×2/line) approximated by radius — content tuning later; SIG buff (Sigma Catalyst) + mutation reroll (Adaptation Fluid) deferred to mutation/meta systems. 17 Vitest cases (heal + clamp, single-instance consume, AoE true/physical damage, status AoE, all rejection paths, no-consume-on-failure, purity, determinism). Typecheck + lint + 79 tests + build green. | Game Engineer | P0       | GDD §9.2          | DONE |
| T-64  | ~~Enemy phase resolution (initiative order, decide-and-act)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28; REWORKED 2026-05-28 (telegraph removed).** `resolveEnemyPhase(state, rng)` in `enemy-phase.ts`: living enemies act once each in descending AGI order (id tie-break, deterministic). **Decide-and-act model** — each enemy evaluates the *live* board at resolution time: if the player is in melee reach (Chebyshev ≤ 1) it attacks (STR − RES, clamped ≥ 0); otherwise it steps one tile toward the player (blocked by bounds/walls/player/other enemies; `rooted` enemies can't move). No pre-committed telegraph. Wired `endTurn` + `wait` → `endPlayerTurn`: phase→enemy, resolve, then AP refresh, ability-cooldown decrement, turn++, phase→player, with `phaseChanged` effects both ways. **Design change (see GDD §6.2.1 / TDD §5.3):** the original "resolve last turn's telegraph, then telegraph next" model created a stale-intent wasted round (enemy arrives adjacent but can't strike until the following turn) and pushed combat toward reaction over planning. Cut for a Heroes 3 / Fire Emblem planning model. `EnemyState.telegraph` field retained as a seam for *scripted* boss wind-ups only. 21 Vitest cases (attack: adjacent/diagonal/pierce/clamp; move: step/wall/enemy-block/rooted; close-then-attack-no-wasted-turn; dead skip; initiative + tie-break; purity) + turn-flow tests. Typecheck + lint + 121 tests + build green. | Game Engineer | P0       | TDD §5.3, GDD §6.2 | DONE |
| T-65  | ~~Status effect tick (Burn, Infected, Stagger, Suppressed, Fractured, Crushed, Rooted, Phased, Regenerating, Overheated)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `tickStatuses(state)` in `status-tick.ts`: per-turn HP effects (Burn −5 thermal, Overheated −8 thermal, Regenerating +5, clamped), then decrements all timers and expires at 0 (`statusExpired`). Runs on player + every living enemy once per cycle (wired into `endPlayerTurn`). Burn stacks. Emits `damageDealt`/`healingApplied`/`entityDied`(enemy). Rooted now blocks movement (player in `applyMove`, enemy in `enemy-phase`). **Deferred** (note): the non-damaging *modifier* application — Infected −5 RES, Stagger −1 AP, Fractured +20% dmg-taken, Crushed move-range — needs a shared effective-stats layer; lands with scene/combat polish. Phased (targeting) + Suppressed (ability use) already enforced in handlers. 11 Vitest cases. | Game Engineer | P0 | GDD §6.5 | DONE |
| T-66  | ~~Win/loss/floor-complete detection~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `detectOutcome(state, cause?)` in `outcome.ts`: player HP 0 → `defeat`; all enemies dead → `floor_complete` (or `victory` on floor 20); idempotent on terminal phases. Centralized in `TurnEngine.apply` — runs after every successful action so a killing blow ends the floor immediately. Death-cause threading: `endPlayerTurn` passes `status_tick` when a Burn/Overheat tick is lethal, else `enemy_kill`; `surrender` action now sets `defeat` with cause `surrender`. Added `DeathCause` union (GDD §6.7) + typed the `defeat` effect. 10 Vitest cases (incl. apply()-integration: killing blow → floor_complete, surrender, victory). | Game Engineer | P0       | TDD §5.3          | DONE |
| T-67  | ~~Telegraph generation for next enemy turn~~ — **REVERTED / RETIRED 2026-05-28.** Originally shipped `generateTelegraphs(state)` in `telegraph.ts` (baseline chase AI pre-committing `melee`/`move`). **Removed** when the baseline telegraph was cut in favour of decide-and-act (see T-64 rework + GDD §6.2.1). `telegraph.ts`, `telegraph.test.ts`, the `generateTelegraphs` export, and the `endPlayerTurn` wiring were all deleted. Baseline AI now needs no telegraph-generation step. Telegraphs survive only as a future *scripted-wind-up* seam (boss charges) — that work is folded into the boss/enemy-behaviour tasks (S-3.3+ / E-4 combat), not a standalone generator. **No longer a P0 deliverable.** | Game Engineer | —        | GDD §6.2.1        | RETIRED |
| T-67.5 | ~~CombatSandboxScene — first playable prototype~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `src/scenes/CombatSandboxScene.ts` created. Hardcoded 7×7 `RunState` (player STR 10/RES 5, 2 enemies: "grunt" STR 8 and "brute" STR 12). Phaser `Graphics` rendering: tile grid (static layer), hover overlay (pointermove), entity layer (player teal circle, enemy1 red, enemy2 orange, dead grey). HP bars (4px, per-entity top-of-tile), HP numbers, and a legible "! in reach" threat marker over any enemy adjacent to the player (not a telegraph — derived from the live ruleset, per the T-64 rework / GDD §6.2.1). Input: tap open adjacent tile → `move` action; tap adjacent enemy → `attack`; End Turn button → `endTurn`. `Effect[]` read-back: damage, death, move, phase-change, heal, status logged in 9-line scrolling log. Defeat/floor-complete/victory → grid overlay with big label + RESTART button. HUD: turn, phase, HP/AP. Hover: green highlight for reachable moves, red for attackable enemies, dim grey for OOB. All routed through `TurnEngine.apply` — engine stays engine-agnostic. `main.ts` swapped to boot directly into sandbox. Typecheck + build + 121 tests all green. | Frontend | P0 | E-3 ↔ E-4 bridge | DONE |
| T-68  | ~~Vitest: every Action type, every edge case~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** All 7 Action types covered by dedicated test files (move, attack, useAbility, useItem, wait — new `turn-engine.wait.test.ts`; endTurn via enemy-phase.test.ts; surrender via outcome.test.ts). Added tile-target ability error cases (out-of-bounds + out-of-range) + rooted-player move guard. **Coverage: 100% lines, 97.48% branches on `/core/turn-engine/`** (target was 80%). Remaining 2.5% branch gap is defensive code annotated in `enemy-phase.ts` (unreachable until ranged AI lands). | QA | P0 | TDD §16.1 | DONE |
| T-69  | ~~Performance harness: per-turn resolution <16ms on iPhone X~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `turn-engine.perf.test.ts` runs 8 perf tests against a realistic mid-floor fixture (7×7 grid, 5 enemies, abilities + statuses + items). Asserts p50 < 4ms dev-machine (≈ 16ms iPhone X at conservative 4× speedup factor). Measured headroom: p50 0.006–0.030ms across all action types — **>100× margin vs the assertion gate**. Logs p50/p95/max on every run for regression visibility. | QA | P1 | TDD §5.7, §15 | DONE |

### S-3.3 — Floor Generation

| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------- | --------------- | ----- |
| T-70  | ~~Floor template loader (JSON → in-memory template)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `parseFloorTemplate(input: unknown)` returns a `{ ok, template }` / `{ ok: false, error }` discriminated union; never throws. Co-evolved the `FloorTemplate` schema in `@shared-types/floor-template` (same pattern as Action/RunState). Loader validates every field, enum, range, weight-sum (~1.0 ±0.001), and intra-template invariants (min ≤ max; minima ≤ max). First Floor 1 (Shallows) fixture shipped in `packages/content/floors/floor_01.json`, round-trips through the loader as a behavioural test. 43 new tests covering all 14 error codes + happy path + purity. | Game Engineer | P0 | TDD §7.1 | DONE |
| T-71  | ~~Room placement algorithm (graph layout)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `placeRooms(template, rng) → FloorGraph` in `apps/game/src/core/floor-gen/room-placement.ts`, implements all three `ConnectivityRule` topologies: `linear` (chain), `branching` (tree by incremental random attachment, boss = deepest non-adjacent room), `loop` (ring with start/boss on opposite arcs). Co-evolved the `FloorGraph` / `RoomNode` / `FloorEdge` schema in `@shared-types/floor-graph`. Shared BFS + adjacency utilities in `floor-gen/graph.ts` for T-72 reuse. Per-topology safe minimums (linear/branching: 3, loop: 4) — unsatisfiable templates throw. Enforces every graph invariant: roomCount range respected, unique ids + positions, edges reference real rooms, start ≠ boss, start/boss never directly connected, all rooms reachable from start. 28 new tests. | Game Engineer | P0 | TDD §7.1 | DONE |
| T-71.5 | ~~**FloorGraphSandboxScene**~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** New Phaser scene (`apps/game/src/scenes/FloorGraphSandboxScene.ts`) visualising the output of `placeRooms()`. Renders the `FloorGraph` topology as nodes (filled circles with room-id labels) + edges (lines); start room highlighted teal (`#a0ffdc`), boss room highlighted red (`#ff4444`). **REROLL** button advances the seed via `Mulberry32(prevSeed).next()` (deterministic) and re-runs placement; **TOPOLOGY** button cycles `linear → branching → loop` for the same Floor 1 fixture, with HUD labelling `[from JSON]` vs `[override]`. HUD shows seed, topology, room count, edge count, BFS max-distance, start/boss IDs. Pure layout helpers (`computeBounds`/`computeLayout`/`project`) extracted to `scenes/floor-graph-layout.ts` and unit-tested (16 new tests, including degenerate zero-width/zero-height cases). Shared `scenes/tab-bar.ts` wired into both sandbox scenes for one-tap navigation; `main.ts` now lists both scenes (`CombatSandboxScene` default). CombatSandbox HUD shifted down 26px to make room. Same precedent as T-67.5. | Frontend | P0 | E-3 ↔ E-4 bridge | DONE |
| T-72  | ~~BFS connectivity validator (start → boss path exists)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `validateConnectivity(graph)` in `apps/game/src/core/floor-gen/connectivity.ts`. Returns the loader-style `{ ok } \| { ok: false, error }` union with typed codes (`MISSING_START`, `MISSING_BOSS`, `START_IS_BOSS`, `BOSS_UNREACHABLE`, `ORPHAN_ROOMS`) so the generation orchestrator (T-79) can retry/fall back. Reuses `bfsDistances` (graph.ts), treats edges as undirected; checks start/boss exist + differ, boss reachable from start, and no room orphaned off the main component. 7 tests incl. all four failure codes + every `placeRooms` output across 3 topologies × 50 seeds. | Game Engineer | P0       | TDD §7.1        | DONE |
| T-73  | ~~Room-type filler (combat/loot/safe/merchant/trap/LACE-event)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `fillRoomTypes(graph, template, rng) → TypedRoom[]` in `room-fill.ts`. Boss room → `boss`; start room → `safe` (guaranteed entrance rest point, counts toward the safe minimum); remaining hard minima placed on earliest open rooms; everything else by weighted random draw over `roomWeights`. Deterministic for a fixed `(graph, rng-state)`; throws when minima can't fit so T-79 retries/falls back. Adds the `floor-plan` contract in `@shared-types` (`TypedRoom`, `EnemySpawn`, `PopulatedRoom`, `PopulatedFloor`). 6 tests: full coverage, boss/start guarantees, every-minimum honoured across 3 topologies × 40 seeds, determinism, valid-types, minima-overflow throw. | Game Engineer | P0       | GDD §7.2-§7.3   | DONE — weighted, with min-guarantees |
| T-74  | ~~Enemy placement per room type~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `buildRoom(typed, template, rng) → PopulatedRoom` in `encounter.ts`. Combat rooms get 2–4 enemies drawn from `enemyPool`, placed on distinct tiles in the far half of the grid (never the player's bottom-centre entry tile); boss room spawns exactly `bossId`; all other types get none. Deterministic for fixed `(typed, template, rng-state)`. Per-floor stat scaling deferred to T-78. 7 tests. | Game Engineer | P0       | TDD §7.1        | DONE |
| T-75  | ~~Hazard placement (1–3 per combat room)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** Combat rooms get 1–3 `hazard` tiles stamped into the grid (`withHazards` in `encounter.ts`), placed on open tiles that avoid the player spawn and every enemy spawn. Hazards live in the grid itself (no parallel list). Non-combat and boss rooms stay hazard-free. Deterministic. +3 tests (count range, no-overlap, non-combat empty). | Game Engineer | P0       | GDD §6.1, §7.2  | DONE |
| T-76  | Codex fragment placement (0–4 per floor, non-boss rooms)              | Game Engineer | P1       | GDD §7.2        | |
| T-77  | ~~Boss-room handling (10×10 grid, locked door)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** Boss room produced by the same `buildRoom` dispatch (routes on `type === 'boss'`): 10×10 arena (`BOSS_ROOM_SIZE`), `locked: true` door, single boss spawn from `bossId` kept off the player entry tile, hazard-free. Arena size constants (`STANDARD_ROOM_SIZE` 7, `BOSS_ROOM_SIZE` 10) exported for combat-setup/renderer. Dedicated 6-test boss suite locks in the invariants. | Game Engineer | P0       | GDD §7.4        | DONE |

| T-79  | ~~Fallback: fixed template after 5 failed gen attempts~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `generateFloor(template, rng) → PopulatedFloor` orchestrator in `generate-floor.ts` runs the full pipeline (placeRooms → validateConnectivity → fillRoomTypes → buildRoom per room). Each attempt that throws (cramped loop, impossible minima) or fails connectivity retries against the advanced RNG stream; after `MAX_GEN_ATTEMPTS` (5) failures returns a deterministic fixed fallback floor (`fromFallback: true`). Fallback is self-contained — linear graph sized for every minimum, deterministic type assignment, no weighted draw — so it cannot itself throw. 8 tests incl. both fallback triggers + fallback validity/minima. | Game Engineer | P0       | TDD §7.1        | DONE |
| T-80  | ~~Vitest: connectivity + room-count + min-guarantee tests~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `floor-gen.invariants.test.ts` — broad property sweep over the whole S-3.3 pipeline via `generateFloor`: connectivity (reachable boss, no orphans), roomCount range (procedural floors), every minimum honoured, exactly one boss + safe start, all spawns/hazards in-bounds with distinct enemy tiles, per-seed determinism. Runs across 3 topologies × 60 seeds, a demanding-minima config, the forced fallback path, and the shipped `floor_01.json` content. 5 tests. (Whole S-3.3 set: 276 tests green; lint + typecheck + web build clean.) | QA            | P0       | TDD §16.1       | DONE |

## E-7 — Content Pipeline

**Scope:** JSON schemas + validators + actual content authoring at three build orders (Prototype / Alpha / Soft launch).

### S-7.1 — Schemas & validators

| ID    | Title                                                  | Role     | Priority | Refs       | Notes |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | -------- | ---------- | ----- |
| T-282 | Mutation schema                                        | Game Engineer | P0 | TDD §8.1   | |
| T-283 | ~~Enemy schema~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `EnemyDef` schema in `@shared-types/enemy` (schemaVersion, id, name, tier `grunt\|elite\|boss`, zone, maxHp, EntityStats, damageType, aestheticTags) + `parseEnemyDef(input)` loader in `apps/game/src/core/content/enemy-loader.ts` — discriminated-union, never-throws, mirrors the floor-template loader (T-70). Shared content-loader plumbing (error model + predicates + field readers) extracted to `core/content/validation.ts` for reuse by the item loader (T-284) and beyond. Runtime `EnemyState` is instantiated from a def at encounter start; per-floor stat scaling deferred to T-78. 10 tests (happy path, JSON-string input, all error codes, stats-block validation, enum rejection). | Game Engineer | P0 | GDD §8     | DONE |
| T-284 | ~~Item schema~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** Extended `ItemDef` in `@shared-types/item` with `name` + `rarity` (`ItemRarity` = common/uncommon/rare/legendary) and added `parseItemDef(input)` in `core/content/item-loader.ts`. Loader validates the on-disk `schemaVersion` then **strips** it — schemaVersion is a file-format concern, not part of the inventory/save shape (NFR P8), unlike `EnemyDef` which is pure content and keeps it. Validates effect against category (consumables require a valid `heal`/`damage`/`applyStatus` effect with bounded amounts + enum damage/status; passive/equipment must be null). Updated the existing turn-engine item/perf/determinism fixtures for the two new fields. 9 tests. Full suite green at 295. | Game Engineer | P0 | GDD §9     | DONE |

## Cross-Epic Dependency Highlights

| Dependency                                          | Implication                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| T-7 (lock title) blocks T-41, T-42, T-45            | App Store account names + domain can't be finalized until trademark is clear                 |
| T-8/T-9 (age rating dry-run) blocks T-407           | TestFlight rating submission needs the questionnaire pre-flighted                            |
| E-3 (core) blocks E-4 (scenes)                      | Scenes can't be wired until the simulation produces stable RunState shapes                   |
| T-30 (determinism CI) blocks every E-3 merge        | Determinism gate must exist before turn-engine work goes through PR review                   |
| T-282–T-288 (schemas) block all content authoring   | Content authors need stable schemas before writing JSON                                      |
| T-289–T-294 (Prototype content) blocks Gate 1       | Without 25 mutations + 1 zone of enemies + Floor 0, the vertical slice can't be tested       |
| E-7 / E-8 content tasks block Gate-N transitions    | Each gate has its own content build order — see GDD §21 and Patch 12                         |
| T-407 (TestFlight rating submission) blocks E-13    | If rating returns >12+, GDD §1.5 and §1.6 need revisiting before launch ops scale up         |
| T-323 (writer contract) is parallel to T-313–T-315  | Director templated fragments ship regardless; writer is upgrade path (DR-004)                |

## Items Explicitly NOT in This Plan (Deferred Per Docs)

Per UFD §11 and GDD scope discipline — these are intentionally **not** broken into tasks at this stage:

- Web demo-specific UI screens beyond what TDD §21 Q5 specifies (Floors 1–2 only)
- Leaderboard detail screens (minimal in v1; expanded in Season 1)
- Friend system (not in v1)
- In-app event teasers (LiveOps content; Phase 5 work)
- Recovery phrase UX (deferred per TDD §11.1 / §10.1 to Season 2+)
- Season pass progression UI (no Season 1 at launch)
- Voice acting (Season 2 target — T-326/T-327 placeholders only)
- Localization beyond English (i18n architecture present; only `en` populated)

## Open Assumptions

| # | Assumption                                                                                       | How to confirm                                       |
| - | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Atlassian Jira will be the issue tracker (workspace TBD — not the corporate `minditsoftware.atlassian.net`) | Director confirms personal workspace or alternate; this plan transfers to ADO with hierarchy re-mapping |
| 2 | Hierarchy = Epic → Story → Task → Sub-task (Jira default)                                        | Confirmed when tracker provisioned                   |
| 3 | All P0 tasks are Phase-1/Phase-2 work; P1 = Alpha; P2 = Soft launch; P3 = Global; P4 = Post-launch | Confirmed by GDD §21.1 schedule                      |
| 4 | Sub-tasks added later during sprint planning when individual tasks need decomposition            | Sprint-planning convention; this plan is the backbone |
| 5 | Story-point estimates added in a follow-up pass via `sa-toolkit:task-estimate`                   | Run that skill next if estimates are wanted          |
| 6 | Writer contract closes in Month 4–6; templated assembly is the default ship path                 | DR-004                                               |
| 7 | All Capacitor community plugins remain maintained through 18-month dev window                    | Monitor; alternate plugins identified as fallback if a plugin is abandoned |
| 8 | Branch.io free tier (≤10K MAU) covers attribution through soft launch                            | TDD §2.3; revisit if MAU approaches 10K              |

---

## Recommended Next Actions

1. **Provision an issue tracker** (Jira personal workspace or ADO) and confirm hierarchy mapping.
2. **Import this list** — task names and descriptions are intentionally written to round-trip cleanly to CSV/JSON.
3. **Run `/task-estimate`** from `sa-toolkit` for story-point estimates if useful for sprint planning.
4. **Execute the trademark search (T-1..T-7) in week 1** so that T-7 unblocks T-41 / T-42 / T-45 before Phase 2 begins.
5. **Kick off Phase 2 prototype work** once E-1 closeout items are done — the Phase 2 backlog starts at T-20 (repo bootstrap) and runs through ~T-300 (Alpha content) over Months 2–11.
