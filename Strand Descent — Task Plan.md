# Strand Descent — Task Plan

| Working title    | Strand Descent (locked 2026-05-27)                           |
| Owner            | Tudor Grigoriu / Empathy Software                    |
| Version          | 1.0                                                  |
| Status           | Pre-Production Lock — task source of truth           |
| Created          | 2026-05-27                                           |
| Target tracker   | Atlassian Jira (workspace TBD) — see Open Assumptions |

This is the canonical task list for delivering Strand Descent to soft launch and global launch per the 18-month Path A schedule (GDD §21). It uses the Jira hierarchy **Epic → Story → Task → Sub-task** so it can be imported into Jira (or Azure DevOps with `Story → Feature → Story → Task` re-mapping) when the tracker is provisioned.

When `ai-factory/sa/core/issues-list.md` is the canonical location per the `sa-toolkit:task-plan` skill, this project doesn't use that folder structure (it's a personal indie game, not a Mindit corporate SA engagement). The task list lives at the repo root.

## How to Read This Document

- **Epics (E-N):** long-lived themes that span months. ~13 total.
- **Stories (S-N.M):** functional chunks within an epic. ~75 total.
- **Tasks (T-N):** units of implementation work, sized at 1–5 days of solo+AI work. ~250 total.
- **Sub-tasks (U-N):** added only where a task genuinely benefits from sub-decomposition; not every task has them.

References columns:
- **GDD / TDD / UFD** = section number or screen ID from the consolidated docs
- **NFR** = non-functional requirement, traced to TDD §1 Engineering Principles (P1–P9), §15 Performance Budgets, §17 Security & Privacy

## Role Legend

For a solo+AI team most roles collapse onto the Director plus Claude Code. Roles are kept on tasks so the plan transfers cleanly to a multi-person team if hired:

| Role               | Realised by (this project)                         |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Director           | Tudor Grigoriu (design, content, business decisions) |
| Architect          | Tudor Grigoriu                                     |
| Backend Developer  | Claude Code (TS Cloud Functions, Firestore)        |
| Frontend Developer | Claude Code (Phaser scenes, UI)                    |
| Game Engineer      | Claude Code (turn engine, RNG, sim)                |
| DevOps Engineer    | Claude Code (CI, build, deploy)                    |
| QA Engineer        | Tudor (manual playtest) + Claude Code (automated tests) |
| Writer             | External contractor (Month 4–6 hire, DR-004) — fallback to Director templated assembly |
| BA / Product       | Tudor Grigoriu                                     |

## Reality Check (2026-05-29)

The build deliberately departed from strict task-ID order to **prove the core loop is fun before deepening the engine** — if a turn-based descent isn't satisfying at Floor 1, there's no point layering systems on top. So work fanned out across stories to stand up a **playable Floor 1 vertical slice** (the `RUN` sandbox): floor generation end-to-end (S-3.3), the save/resume layer (S-3.7: T-110/111/112/113/115/116, T-114/117 partial), the web storage adapter (S-5.1: T-222/223/225), a LACE narrator core (S-3.5: T-96/104), Zone-1 content (T-290 enemies, T-292 items), and a sprite pipeline (T-151) — all ahead of their nominal slot. Three sandbox scenes (`COMBAT` / `FLOOR GRAPH` / `RUN`) bridge E-3 ↔ E-4.

The verdict from that slice: the loop holds up — which is why the **Genetic Mutation System (S-3.4)** was the next focus. It's the literal Strand Event, the pillar the game is named around, and was the one empty core directory. **S-3.4 is now complete (2026-05-29): T-82 → T-95 all DONE**, one task per commit, every line tested — the deterministic weighted card draw, tier progression, reroll, modifier application, Dominant Trait + Hybrid Synergy detection, the VEIN Intermission cap gate, and SIG accrual, all backed by 25 shipped Minor mutations (T-289) and a 92-test suite. The remaining gap is *scene wiring* — surfacing the Strand Event in the RUN sandbox and wiring Dominant/Synergy combat effects into the turn engine (tracked with E-4 combat work).

Status markers in the tables below were reconciled against git history on 2026-05-29; rows that shipped during the vertical-slice push but were left blank have been flipped to DONE with their commit noted.

Steps: pnpm install (frozen-lockfile) → lint → typecheck → test → validate → build:web → build:demo. Fixed blockers: `apps/functions/src/index.ts` placeholder (tsc no-inputs), `@types/node` added to functions, `vitest.config.ts` added to both game + functions (`passWithNoTests: true`). Full sequence verified green locally. | DevOps | P0 | TDD §14.3 | DONE |
| T-29  | ~~Add web build step + Firebase Hosting preview channel per PR~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `deploy` job added to `ci.yml` (`needs: ci`). On PR: `FirebaseExtended/action-hosting-deploy` creates preview channel + posts URL as PR comment. On push to main: deploys to live channel. Project ID: `strand-descent`. Requires `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` secret (set). | DevOps | P0 | TDD §14.3 | DONE |
| T-30  | ~~Add determinism replay test job (100 fixed seeds; assert stable output)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `src/core/rng/determinism-replay.test.ts` created. Two tests: (1) every seed produces identical output on repeated runs; (2) output independent of evaluation order (cross-seed state leak). Dedicated `test:determinism` script + separate `"Determinism replay (100 fixed seeds)"` step in `ci.yml`. Runs 2,000 calls × 5 sub-generators per seed. Both tests pass. **STRENGTHENED 2026-05-28** (Sprint 0 of codebase review): the gate previously fingerprinted only the raw RNG sub-generators, leaving the actual simulation unguarded. Now three tiers over the same 100 fixed seeds — (1) RNG sub-generators; (2) **TurnEngine**: a full headless combat run driven by a fixed state-only policy, fingerprinting the whole trajectory (every action's effects + resulting state), plus an action-log replay asserting the seed + log → identical `RunState` save/resume contract; (3) **FloorGen**: `placeRooms` across all 3 topologies + the Floor 1 template. Each tier asserts repeat-stability, evaluation-order independence, and seed-spread (no vacuous pass). Canonical sorted-key serialisation. 10 tests. Pulls forward the headless-replay portion of T-391. | QA | P0 | TDD §16.2, T4 | DONE |
| T-31  | Add Lighthouse CI gate (>= 85) on web build                    | DevOps   | P1       | TDD §15        | |

| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| T-46  | ~~Install Phaser 3.80+ in `apps/game`~~ — **DONE 2026-05-27.** Phaser **3.90.0** resolved + installed (485 total packages via `pnpm install`, lockfile committed). pnpm@9.15.9 installed globally first. | Frontend | P0 | TDD §2.1 | DONE |
| T-47  | ~~Install + configure Capacitor 6.x (iOS + Android)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** All packages installed (T-46). `npx cap init` generated `apps/game/capacitor.config.ts` (appId `software.empathy.strand`, webDir `dist`). `npx cap add ios` scaffolded `apps/game/ios/` (Xcode workspace + Podfile). `npx cap add android` scaffolded `apps/game/android/` (Gradle project). | Frontend | P0 | TDD §2.1 | DONE |
| T-48  | ~~Configure Vite 5.x dev server + production build for both `game` and `demo` entries~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `apps/game/vite.config.ts` created. Mode-switched on `--mode demo`: `outDir` → `dist-demo`, `__DEMO_MODE__` → `true`, sourcemaps disabled. Production build: `outDir` → `dist`, `__DEMO_MODE__` → `false`, sourcemaps on. Path aliases wired for all `@core/*`, `@scenes/*`, `@platform/*`, `@ui/*`, `@shared-types/*`, `@balance/*`, `@content/*`.

## E-3 — Core Simulation Engine

**Scope:** The deterministic, engine-agnostic TypeScript core. Zero Phaser imports. NFRs P1, P2, P4, P7, P8 all live here.

### S-3.1 — RNG (Mulberry32)

| ID    | Title                                                                 | Role          | Priority | Refs            | Notes |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------- | --------------- | ----- |
| T-52  | ~~Implement `Mulberry32` in `core/rng/mulberry32.ts` (~10 lines)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `Mulberry32` class with `next(): float`, `nextInt(n): int`, serialisable `state` field. Implemented as prerequisite for T-30. | Game Engineer | P0 | TDD §6.1 | DONE |
| T-53  | ~~Sub-generator factory keyed by label (`combat`, `loot`, `floorgen`, `mutationdraw`, `events`)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `makeRng(rootSeed, label)` in `mulberry32.ts`. djb2-variant `hashLabel()` XORs root seed with label hash — adding new labels never shifts existing sub-generators. | Game Engineer | P0 | TDD §6.1 | DONE |
| T-54  | Daily seed: `hash(date_UTC + global_salt)` → 32 bits                  | Game Engineer | P1       | TDD §6.2        | |
| T-55  | Weekly seed: `hash(ISO_week + global_salt)` → 32 bits                 | Game Engineer | P1       | TDD §6.2        | |
| T-56  | ~~Vitest: distribution test (Chi-squared on 1M samples per sub-gen)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `mulberry32.test.ts`. χ²(100 bins, 1M samples) < 148.23 (critical value df=99, α=0.001) for all 5 sub-generators + direct Mulberry32. All pass in ~305ms. Post-commit CI typecheck fix 2026-05-28: added `!` non-null assertion on `counts[idx]!++` to satisfy `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true` in tsconfig.base.json. | QA | P0 | TDD §16.1 | DONE |
| T-57  | ~~Vitest: seed isolation test (changing one sub-gen seed doesn't shift others)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `mulberry32.test.ts`. Three isolation tests: (1) advancing combat 50K steps doesn't shift loot sequence; (2) different labels produce distinct sequences from same root seed; (3) same label + different seeds produce distinct sequences. Plus nextInt bounds check (10K calls). | QA | P0 | TDD §16.1 | DONE |

### S-3.2 — Turn Engine

| ID    | Title                                                                 | Role          | Priority | Refs              | Notes |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| T-58  | ~~`Action` discriminated union in `packages/shared-types`~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `packages/shared-types/src/action.ts` created. Union covers 7 action types: `move` (targetPos), `attack` (targetId), `useAbility` (abilityId + optional targetId/targetPos), `useItem` (itemId + optional targetId), `wait`, `endTurn`, `surrender`. Supporting types: `Position`, `ActionType`. Exported from `index.ts`. All types `readonly`. Typecheck passes. | Game Engineer | P0       | TDD §5.2          | DONE |
| T-59  | ~~`TurnEngine.apply(state, action, rng) → { state, effects, errors }`~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `apps/game/src/core/turn-engine/` created. `RunState` + `PlayerState` + `EnemyState` + `TurnPhase` + `EntityStats` + `StatusEffect` + `ActiveStatus` in `packages/shared-types/src/run-state.ts`. `Effect` (14-variant union) in `effect.ts`. `TurnError` / `TurnErrorCode` in `turn-error.ts`. `TurnEngine.apply` dispatch in `turn-engine.ts`: exhaustive switch over all 7 Action types, each stub validates phase and returns `{ state, effects: [], errors: [] }`. `ok()`/`err()` helpers. Barrel `index.ts`. Also removed `rootDir: "src"` from `apps/game/tsconfig.json` (cross-package path alias imports require it). | Game Engineer | P0       | TDD §5.1          | DONE — NFR P2/P4 |
| T-60  | ~~Move validation + execution~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `applyMove` in `turn-engine.ts` fully implemented per GDD §6.3 (1 AP/tile, 1 tile/action, diagonals allowed). Validates: player phase, in-bounds, Chebyshev distance == 1, target not a wall, target not occupied by a living enemy, sufficient AP. On success: moves player, deducts `MOVE_AP_COST` (1), emits `entityMoved` + `apSpent` effects. Added `GridState`/`TileType` to `RunState` (`packages/shared-types/src/run-state.ts`) — movement needs grid bounds + walls. New `grid.ts` helpers: `inBounds`, `tileAt`, `chebyshev` (reused by attack/floor-gen later). 14 Vitest cases in `turn-engine.move.test.ts` (valid/diagonal/effects/purity/all rejection paths/determinism). Typecheck + lint + build green. | Game Engineer | P0       | TDD §5.3          | DONE |
| T-61  | ~~Attack validation + damage calc (STR/RES, crit, damage type)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `applyAttack` in `turn-engine.ts` (basic melee attack). Validates: player phase, target exists (`TARGET_NOT_FOUND`), target alive, target not `phased` (untargetable), within melee range (Chebyshev ≤ 1), sufficient AP. Damage = `floor(STR × 1.0)`, ×1.5 on crit (applied before mitigation), then flat RES subtraction, clamped `max(0, …)`. Crit roll consumes one `rng.next()` — chance = 5% base + 0.5%/AGI over base (tunable, pending Economy.xlsx). Emits `damageDealt` (`damageType: 'physical'`) + `entityDied` (if HP→0) + `apSpent`. Status application (Stagger) deferred to T-65; accuracy/dodge and ranged-equipment (STR×0.8) deferred. 16 Vitest cases (damage, crit-before-mitigation, no-negative-damage, death, single-target, purity, all rejection paths, determinism). Typecheck + lint + 42 tests green. | Game Engineer | P0       | GDD §6.3-§6.6     | DONE |
| T-62  | ~~Ability targeting + cooldown tracking~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `applyUseAbility` in `turn-engine.ts`. New `AbilityDef`/`AbilitySlot`/`AbilityTargetType` in `packages/shared-types/src/ability.ts` (apCost, cooldown, range, targetType, baseDamage, damageType, intScaling, aoeRadius, appliesStatus, statusDuration). `PlayerState.abilities` now `readonly AbilitySlot[]` (per-ability `cooldownRemaining` lives in RunState → survives save/resume). Targeting modes: `enemy` (single + Chebyshev-radius splash), `tile` (in-bounds, range-checked, AoE), `self` (status to player). Damage = `baseDamage + floor(INT × intScaling)`, mitigated by RES (True ignores it); abilities do **not** crit (crit is a basic-attack mechanic, GDD §6.6) so resolution consumes no RNG. Cooldown set to `def.cooldown` on use; per-turn decrement deferred to turn-flow (T-64/T-66). Suppressed status blocks use. Also added `DamageType` union (GDD §6.4) + tightened `effect.ts` `damageDealt.damageType`/`statusApplied.status` to real unions, and extracted shared `combat.ts` (`mitigate`/`rollCrit`/`applyCrit`), refactoring T-61's attack onto it. New error codes: `ABILITY_NOT_FOUND`, `ABILITY_SUPPRESSED`. 20 Vitest cases (INT scaling, true damage, cooldown set+block, status apply, no-status-on-kill, self-buff, tile + enemy AoE, all rejection paths, purity, determinism). Typecheck + lint + 62 tests + build green. | Game Engineer | P0       | GDD §6.3          | DONE |
| T-63  | ~~Item use resolution~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `applyUseItem` in `turn-engine.ts` resolves consumables (single-use, 1 AP, no cooldown — GDD §9.2). New `ItemDef`/`ItemCategory`/`ItemEffect` in `packages/shared-types/src/item.ts`; `PlayerState.items` now `readonly ItemDef[]`. `ItemEffect` union: `heal` (self, clamped to maxHp, reports actual healed), `damage` (tile-targeted Chebyshev AoE, RES-mitigated, True ignores RES), `applyStatus` (tile-targeted AoE). Validates phase, item in inventory (`ITEM_NOT_FOUND`), is consumable (`ITEM_NOT_CONSUMABLE`), AP, and tile target in-bounds for grenades. Consumes exactly one instance on success; emits `itemUsed` → effect-specific → `apSpent`. RNG-free (items don't crit). Added `targetPos?` to `UseItemAction` (matches TDD §5.2 `target?: Tile`). AoE shapes (2×2/line) approximated by radius — content tuning later; SIG buff (Sigma Catalyst) + mutation reroll (Adaptation Fluid) deferred to mutation/meta systems. 17 Vitest cases (heal + clamp, single-instance consume, AoE true/physical damage, status AoE, all rejection paths, no-consume-on-failure, purity, determinism). Typecheck + lint + 79 tests + build green. | Game Engineer | P0       | GDD §9.2          | DONE |
| T-64  | ~~Enemy phase resolution (initiative order, decide-and-act)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28; REWORKED 2026-05-28 (telegraph removed).** `resolveEnemyPhase(state, rng)` in `enemy-phase.ts`: living enemies act once each in descending AGI order (id tie-break, deterministic). **Decide-and-act model** — each enemy evaluates the *live* board at resolution time: if the player is in melee reach (Chebyshev ≤ 1) it attacks (STR − RES, clamped ≥ 0); otherwise it steps one tile toward the player (blocked by bounds/walls/player/other enemies; `rooted` enemies can't move). No pre-committed telegraph. Wired `endTurn` + `wait` → `endPlayerTurn`: phase→enemy, resolve, then AP refresh, ability-cooldown decrement, turn++, phase→player, with `phaseChanged` effects both ways. **Design change (see GDD §6.2.1 / TDD §5.3):** the original "resolve last turn's telegraph, then telegraph next" model created a stale-intent wasted round (enemy arrives adjacent but can't strike until the following turn) and pushed combat toward reaction over planning. Cut for a Heroes 3 / Fire Emblem planning model. `EnemyState.telegraph` field retained as a seam for *scripted* boss wind-ups only. 21 Vitest cases (attack: adjacent/diagonal/pierce/clamp; move: step/wall/enemy-block/rooted; close-then-attack-no-wasted-turn; dead skip; initiative + tie-break; purity) + turn-flow tests. Typecheck + lint + 121 tests + build green. | Game Engineer | P0       | TDD §5.3, GDD §6.2 | DONE |
| T-65  | ~~Status effect tick (Burn, Infected, Stagger, Suppressed, Fractured, Crushed, Rooted, Phased, Regenerating, Overheated)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `tickStatuses(state)` in `status-tick.ts`: per-turn HP effects (Burn −5 thermal, Overheated −8 thermal, Regenerating +5, clamped), then decrements all timers and expires at 0 (`statusExpired`). Runs on player + every living enemy once per cycle (wired into `endPlayerTurn`). Burn stacks. Emits `damageDealt`/`healingApplied`/`entityDied`(enemy). Rooted now blocks movement (player in `applyMove`, enemy in `enemy-phase`). **Deferred** (note): the non-damaging *modifier* application — Infected −5 RES, Stagger −1 AP, Fractured +20% dmg-taken, Crushed move-range — needs a shared effective-stats layer; lands with scene/combat polish. Phased (targeting) + Suppressed (ability use) already enforced in handlers. 11 Vitest cases. **Modifier layer completed 2026-05-28:** `effective-stats.ts` now resolves the deferred non-damaging modifiers — Infected −5 RES, Fractured ×1.2 damage taken, Stagger −1 effective max AP, Crushed immobilise (with Rooted) — read through one place by the turn engine (3 damage sites + AP refresh + move guard) and enemy phase (attack + step). 8 more tests. | Game Engineer | P0 | GDD §6.5 | DONE |
| T-66  | ~~Win/loss/floor-complete detection~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `detectOutcome(state, cause?)` in `outcome.ts`: player HP 0 → `defeat`; all enemies dead → `floor_complete` (or `victory` on floor 20); idempotent on terminal phases. Centralized in `TurnEngine.apply` — runs after every successful action so a killing blow ends the floor immediately. Death-cause threading: `endPlayerTurn` passes `status_tick` when a Burn/Overheat tick is lethal, else `enemy_kill`; `surrender` action now sets `defeat` with cause `surrender`. Added `DeathCause` union (GDD §6.7) + typed the `defeat` effect. 10 Vitest cases (incl. apply()-integration: killing blow → floor_complete, surrender, victory). | Game Engineer | P0       | TDD §5.3          | DONE |
| T-67  | ~~Telegraph generation for next enemy turn~~ — **REVERTED / RETIRED 2026-05-28.** Originally shipped `generateTelegraphs(state)` in `telegraph.ts` (baseline chase AI pre-committing `melee`/`move`). **Removed** when the baseline telegraph was cut in favour of decide-and-act (see T-64 rework + GDD §6.2.1). `telegraph.ts`, `telegraph.test.ts`, the `generateTelegraphs` export, and the `endPlayerTurn` wiring were all deleted. Baseline AI now needs no telegraph-generation step. Telegraphs survive only as a future *scripted-wind-up* seam (boss charges) — that work is folded into the boss/enemy-behaviour tasks (S-3.3+ / E-4 combat), not a standalone generator. **No longer a P0 deliverable.** | Game Engineer | —        | GDD §6.2.1        | RETIRED |
| T-67.5 | ~~CombatSandboxScene — first playable prototype~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `src/scenes/CombatSandboxScene.ts` created. Hardcoded 7×7 `RunState` (player STR 10/RES 5, 2 enemies: "grunt" STR 8 and "brute" STR 12). Phaser `Graphics` rendering: tile grid (static layer), hover overlay (pointermove), entity layer (player teal circle, enemy1 red, enemy2 orange, dead grey). HP bars (4px, per-entity top-of-tile), HP numbers, and a legible "! in reach" threat marker over any enemy adjacent to the player (not a telegraph — derived from the live ruleset, per the T-64 rework / GDD §6.2.1). Input: tap open adjacent tile → `move` action; tap adjacent enemy → `attack`; End Turn button → `endTurn`. `Effect[]` read-back: damage, death, move, phase-change, heal, status logged in 9-line scrolling log. Defeat/floor-complete/victory → grid overlay with big label + RESTART button. HUD: turn, phase, HP/AP. Hover: green highlight for reachable moves, red for attackable enemies, dim grey for OOB. All routed through `TurnEngine.apply` — engine stays engine-agnostic. `main.ts` swapped to boot directly into sandbox. Typecheck + build + 121 tests all green. | Frontend | P0 | E-3 ↔ E-4 bridge | DONE |
| T-68  | ~~Vitest: every Action type, every edge case~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** All 7 Action types covered by dedicated test files (move, attack, useAbility, useItem, wait — new `turn-engine.wait.test.ts`; endTurn via enemy-phase.test.ts; surrender via outcome.test.ts). Added tile-target ability error cases (out-of-bounds + out-of-range) + rooted-player move guard. **Coverage: 100% lines, 97.48% branches on `/core/turn-engine/`** (target was 80%). Remaining 2.5% branch gap is defensive code annotated in `enemy-phase.ts` (unreachable until ranged AI lands). | QA | P0 | TDD §16.1 | DONE |
| T-69  | ~~Performance harness: per-turn resolution <16ms on iPhone X~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `turn-engine.perf.test.ts` runs 8 perf tests against a realistic mid-floor fixture (7×7 grid, 5 enemies, abilities + statuses + items). Asserts p50 < 4ms dev-machine (≈ 16ms iPhone X at conservative 4× speedup factor). Measured headroom: p50 0.006–0.030ms across all action types — **>100× margin vs the assertion gate**. Logs p50/p95/max on every run for regression visibility. | QA | P1 | TDD §5.7, §15 | DONE |

### S-3.3 — Floor Generation

| ID    | Title                                                                 | Role          | Priority | Refs            | Notes |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------- | --------------- | ----- |
| T-70  | ~~Floor template loader (JSON → in-memory template)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `parseFloorTemplate(input: unknown)` returns a `{ ok, template }` / `{ ok: false, error }` discriminated union; never throws. Co-evolved the `FloorTemplate` schema in `@shared-types/floor-template` (same pattern as Action/RunState). Loader validates every field, enum, range, weight-sum (~1.0 ±0.001), and intra-template invariants (min ≤ max; minima ≤ max). First Floor 1 (Shallows) fixture shipped in `packages/content/floors/floor_01.json`, round-trips through the loader as a behavioural test. 43 new tests covering all 14 error codes + happy path + purity. | Game Engineer | P0 | TDD §7.1 | DONE |
| T-71  | ~~Room placement algorithm (graph layout)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `placeRooms(template, rng) → FloorGraph` in `apps/game/src/core/floor-gen/room-placement.ts`, implements all three `ConnectivityRule` topologies: `linear` (chain), `branching` (tree by incremental random attachment, boss = deepest non-adjacent room), `loop` (ring with start/boss on opposite arcs). Co-evolved the `FloorGraph` / `RoomNode` / `FloorEdge` schema in `@shared-types/floor-graph`. Shared BFS + adjacency utilities in `floor-gen/graph.ts` for T-72 reuse. Per-topology safe minimums (linear/branching: 3, loop: 4) — unsatisfiable templates throw. Enforces every graph invariant: roomCount range respected, unique ids + positions, edges reference real rooms, start ≠ boss, start/boss never directly connected, all rooms reachable from start. 28 new tests. | Game Engineer | P0 | TDD §7.1 | DONE |
| T-71.5 | ~~**FloorGraphSandboxScene**~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** New Phaser scene (`apps/game/src/scenes/FloorGraphSandboxScene.ts`) visualising the output of `placeRooms()`. Renders the `FloorGraph` topology as nodes (filled circles with room-id labels) + edges (lines); start room highlighted teal (`#a0ffdc`), boss room highlighted red (`#ff4444`). **REROLL** button advances the seed via `Mulberry32(prevSeed).next()` (deterministic) and re-runs placement; **TOPOLOGY** button cycles `linear → branching → loop` for the same Floor 1 fixture, with HUD labelling `[from JSON]` vs `[override]`. HUD shows seed, topology, room count, edge count, BFS max-distance, start/boss IDs. Pure layout helpers (`computeBounds`/`computeLayout`/`project`) extracted to `scenes/floor-graph-layout.ts` and unit-tested (16 new tests, including degenerate zero-width/zero-height cases). Shared `scenes/tab-bar.ts` wired into both sandbox scenes for one-tap navigation; `main.ts` now lists both scenes (`CombatSandboxScene` default). CombatSandbox HUD shifted down 26px to make room. Same precedent as T-67.5. | Frontend | P0 | E-3 ↔ E-4 bridge | DONE |
| T-72  | ~~BFS connectivity validator (start → boss path exists)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `validateConnectivity(graph)` in `apps/game/src/core/floor-gen/connectivity.ts`. Returns the loader-style `{ ok } \| { ok: false, error }` union with typed codes (`MISSING_START`, `MISSING_BOSS`, `START_IS_BOSS`, `BOSS_UNREACHABLE`, `ORPHAN_ROOMS`) so the generation orchestrator (T-79) can retry/fall back. Reuses `bfsDistances` (graph.ts), treats edges as undirected; checks start/boss exist + differ, boss reachable from start, and no room orphaned off the main component. 7 tests incl. all four failure codes + every `placeRooms` output across 3 topologies × 50 seeds. | Game Engineer | P0       | TDD §7.1        | DONE |
| T-73  | ~~Room-type filler (combat/loot/safe/merchant/trap/LACE-event)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `fillRoomTypes(graph, template, rng) → TypedRoom[]` in `room-fill.ts`. Boss room → `boss`; start room → `safe` (guaranteed entrance rest point, counts toward the safe minimum); remaining hard minima placed on earliest open rooms; everything else by weighted random draw over `roomWeights`. Deterministic for a fixed `(graph, rng-state)`; throws when minima can't fit so T-79 retries/falls back. Adds the `floor-plan` contract in `@shared-types` (`TypedRoom`, `EnemySpawn`, `PopulatedRoom`, `PopulatedFloor`). 6 tests: full coverage, boss/start guarantees, every-minimum honoured across 3 topologies × 40 seeds, determinism, valid-types, minima-overflow throw. | Game Engineer | P0       | GDD §7.2-§7.3   | DONE — weighted, with min-guarantees |
| T-74  | ~~Enemy placement per room type~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `buildRoom(typed, template, rng) → PopulatedRoom` in `encounter.ts`. Combat rooms get 2–4 enemies drawn from `enemyPool`, placed on distinct tiles in the far half of the grid (never the player's bottom-centre entry tile); boss room spawns exactly `bossId`; all other types get none. Deterministic for fixed `(typed, template, rng-state)`. Per-floor stat scaling deferred to T-78. 7 tests. | Game Engineer | P0       | TDD §7.1        | DONE |
| T-75  | ~~Hazard placement (1–3 per combat room)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** Combat rooms get 1–3 `hazard` tiles stamped into the grid (`withHazards` in `encounter.ts`), placed on open tiles that avoid the player spawn and every enemy spawn. Hazards live in the grid itself (no parallel list). Non-combat and boss rooms stay hazard-free. Deterministic. +3 tests (count range, no-overlap, non-combat empty). | Game Engineer | P0       | GDD §6.1, §7.2  | DONE |
| T-76  | Codex fragment placement (0–4 per floor, non-boss rooms)              | Game Engineer | P1       | GDD §7.2        | |
| T-77  | ~~Boss-room handling (10×10 grid, locked door)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** Boss room produced by the same `buildRoom` dispatch (routes on `type === 'boss'`): 10×10 arena (`BOSS_ROOM_SIZE`), `locked: true` door, single boss spawn from `bossId` kept off the player entry tile, hazard-free. Arena size constants (`STANDARD_ROOM_SIZE` 7, `BOSS_ROOM_SIZE` 10) exported for combat-setup/renderer. Dedicated 6-test boss suite locks in the invariants. | Game Engineer | P0       | GDD §7.4        | DONE |
| T-78  | ~~Difficulty scaling formula (HP × (1 + floor × 0.15) etc.)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28 (Sprint 4).** `core/run/scaling.ts`: `scaledMaxHp`/`scaledStats` with `factor = 1 + max(0, floor-1)·perFloor` — enemy defs author at the Floor 1 baseline; HP scales 0.15/floor, STR/RES 0.10/floor, AGI/INT flat (stable crit + AI). Applied in `buildEncounterState` when instantiating enemies. 6 scaling tests + encounter cross-check (floor 5 > floor 1, floor 1 = baseline). | Game Engineer | P1       | GDD §7.5        | DONE |
| T-79  | ~~Fallback: fixed template after 5 failed gen attempts~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `generateFloor(template, rng) → PopulatedFloor` orchestrator in `generate-floor.ts` runs the full pipeline (placeRooms → validateConnectivity → fillRoomTypes → buildRoom per room). Each attempt that throws (cramped loop, impossible minima) or fails connectivity retries against the advanced RNG stream; after `MAX_GEN_ATTEMPTS` (5) failures returns a deterministic fixed fallback floor (`fromFallback: true`). Fallback is self-contained — linear graph sized for every minimum, deterministic type assignment, no weighted draw — so it cannot itself throw. 8 tests incl. both fallback triggers + fallback validity/minima. | Game Engineer | P0       | TDD §7.1        | DONE |

Runs across 3 topologies × 60 seeds, a demanding-minima config, the forced fallback path, and the shipped `floor_01.json` content. 5 tests.

Three pieces: (1) `core/run/encounter.ts` `buildEncounterState` — instantiates a combat `RunState` from a generated `PopulatedRoom` + enemy registry (full-HP `EnemyState`s from defs, unique ids, carried player at the entry tile, AP/cooldowns refreshed) + `newRunPlayer` loadout (6 tests); (2) `core/run/run-session.ts` `RunSession` — the run state machine (move across the floor graph, begin/end encounters, auto-clear non-combat rooms, boss clear → floor_complete → `descend` → next floor, final-floor boss → victory; deterministic per master seed; 10 tests incl. a full end-to-end descent to a boss kill through the real TurnEngine); (3) `scenes/RunSandboxScene.ts` — map view (tap adjacent rooms to descend) + combat view (TurnEngine) + LACE narration on run events, booting by default with a new RUN tab. **Seed controls**: the HUD shows the run seed; REPLAY re-runs the same seed (identical run — demonstrates determinism), REROLL advances to a new deterministic seed. Build-verified (typecheck + web build green, dev server boots + serves); not yet visually playtested. **Sprint 4.5 balance pass:** safe rooms now rest the player to full HP (the run-loop's recovery mechanism — `RunSession.restIfSafe`); starting loadout + T-78 scaling tuned via an auto-play balance guard (`balance.test.ts`) that plays full runs with a competent policy across 60 seeds — locked curve **1F 100% · 2F 95% · 3F 0%** (Floor 1 reliably winnable, 2-floor demo beatable, depth walls due to boss-every-floor + one-time consumables). Scene demo set to FINAL_FLOOR 2. | Frontend + Game Engineer | P0 | E-3 ↔ E-4 bridge | DONE |

| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------- | ----------------- | ----- |
| T-82  | ~~JSON schema for mutations~~ — **DONE 2026-05-29.** `MutationDef` in `@shared-types/mutation`: `family` (5), `tier` (minor/major/dominant), flat `name`, `sigBonus`, `modifiers` (`stat`/`maxHp`/`maxAp` deltas targeting real `PlayerState` fields), `grantsAbility: AbilityDef \| null`, `lace` commentary, `tags`. Matches the working item.ts/enemy.ts conventions (flat English strings, `schemaVersion` stripped by loader) rather than the TDD §8.1 sketch (which used locale objects + non-existent `armor`/`crush` targets — divergence noted in the file). `FAMILY_RING` + `core/mutation/family.ts` adjacency helpers (`adjacentFamilies`/`otherFamilies`/`isAdjacent`) give the clean 2/2 split that makes §5.4 weighting sum to 100%. 9 tests. | Game Engineer | P0 | TDD §8.1, GDD §5.2 | DONE |
| T-83  | ~~Mutation loader + schema validator~~ — **DONE 2026-05-29.** `parseMutationDef` in `core/content/mutation-loader.ts` (reuses the shared `validation.ts` plumbing + new `readNonNegativeInt`). Validates every field, both enum sets, the nested `modifiers[]` (stat/maxHp/maxAp + signed deltas) and the full `grantsAbility` AbilityDef (apCost 1–3, cooldown 0–5, ranges, target/damage/status enums) with dotted field paths. Discriminated union, never throws. 3 real Zone-1 mutation fixtures shipped (`abyssal_pressure_membrane` w/ Pressurize, `mycelial_spore_cloud` tile-AoE, `abyssal_deep_lung` passive maxHp). Also completes the content-pipeline side of **T-282**. 40 tests. | Game Engineer | P0 | TDD §8.2 | DONE — NFR P7 |
| T-84  | ~~`pnpm validate:content` aggregates all schema validators~~ — **DONE 2026-05-29.** Mutations wired into the existing `content-bundle.test.ts` gate (the real `pnpm validate` target, T-288): every mutation file is loaded + cross-referenced (id uniqueness) alongside enemies/items/floors. `crossReferenceContent` + `ContentBundle` extended with `mutations`. | DevOps | P0 | TDD §14.1 | DONE |
| T-85  | ~~Card draw: 1 dominant family + 1 adjacent + 1 wild (deterministic)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-29.** `drawMutationCards` in `core/mutation/card-draw.ts`: offers 3 distinct cards — 2 **weighted** (Rule 1) + 1 **wild** (Rule 2, family sampled uniformly). This base layer weights all families equally (exactly Rule 1's "0 mutations owned" case); T-86 layers in the ownership 40/20/20/10/10 weighting. No-duplicates vs the owned set (Rule 4); degrades gracefully to fewer cards when the pool is thin. Deterministic — sole entropy is the supplied `mutationdraw` sub-generator, so seed + owned → identical offer (replayable Strand Events). Shared `test-fixtures.ts` mutation builder. 9 tests. | Game Engineer | P0       | GDD §5.4          | DONE — uses `rng.mutationdraw` |
| T-86  | ~~Family-weighting rule (40/20/20/10/10 etc.)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-29.** `familyWeights(owned)` in `core/mutation/family-weights.ts` returns the per-family weight table the draw's weighted slots sample from: **0 owned** → 20 each (uniform); **1 in the dominant family** → 40 dominant / 20 each adjacent / 10 each other; **2+ in the dominant family** → 50 dominant / 12.5 each of the other four. Dominant = most-owned (ties break by `FAMILY_RING` order → deterministic); a 1-each tie uses the 1-owned rule centred on the ring-first family. Weights always positive, always sum to 100. Wired into `drawMutationCards` (replaced the uniform placeholder); wild card still ignores it (Rule 2). 7 unit tests + a draw-bias integration test. | Game Engineer | P0       | GDD §5.4          | DONE |
| T-87  | ~~No-duplicates filter~~ — **DONE 2026-05-29.** `availableMutations(pool, excludeIds)` in `core/mutation/available.ts` — the Rule 4 gate, extracted so it's tested in isolation. `drawMutationCards` now threads **one growing exclude set** (seeded with the owned ids, gaining each card as drawn): the offer never repeats an owned mutation nor itself. Defensively de-duplicates by id so a stray double-entry in the pool can't surface twice. Preserves pool order. 6 tests. | Game Engineer | P0       | GDD §5.4          | DONE |
| T-88  | ~~Tier progression (Floor 5: 3M; F10: 2M+1Maj; F15: 1M+1Maj+1Dom)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-29.** `tiersForFloor(floor)` in `core/mutation/tiers.ts`: F5–9 → `[minor,minor,minor]`; F10–14 → `[minor,minor,major]`; F15+ → `[minor,major,dominant]` (escalating tier rides the *last*/wild slot). Wired into `drawMutationCards` via a new optional `floor` param (defaults to 1 = all Minor, so earlier callers/tests are unaffected); each `DrawnCard` now reports its required `tier`. A `pickForSlot` fallback chain (tier∩family → tier → family → any) means a thin/minor-only pool degrades gracefully instead of leaving a slot empty — important until Major/Dominant content lands. Constants hoisted to `constants.ts` to break the tiers↔card-draw import cycle. 7 tests. | Game Engineer | P0       | GDD §5.4          | DONE |
| T-89  | ~~Reroll: rerolls **1 player-selected card** via same RNG sub-stream~~ — **DONE 2026-05-29.** `rerollCard({offer, index, pool, owned, rng})` in `core/mutation/reroll.ts` replaces exactly the chosen card (others kept by reference), preserving its slot + tier. Draws from the **same live `mutationdraw` generator** that produced the offer (now advanced) — so draw+reroll replays bit-identically from a recorded RNG state (Rule 5 determinism). Replacement avoids owned + every card on the table + the rerolled card itself, so it always changes when an alternative exists; returns the offer unchanged when nothing is left, throws `RangeError` on a bad index. Shared `drawOneCard` helper extracted from `drawMutationCards` so draw and reroll resolve a card identically (DRY). 7 tests. | Game Engineer | P0       | GDD §5.4 Rule 5   | DONE — DR-006 / Patch 04 |
| T-90  | ~~Modifier application on mutation selection~~ — **DONE 2026-05-29.** `applyMutation(player, mutation)` in `core/mutation/apply.ts` — pure/immutable fold of a selected mutation into `PlayerState`: **stat** deltas (str/res/agi/int, floored at 0), **maxHp** (raises max *and* current HP, max floored at 1, current clamped), **maxAp** (raises max + current AP, floored at 0); grants the active ability ready (cooldown 0); records the id in `mutations`. Idempotent on identity (no duplicate ownership/ability if re-applied). SIG accrual is deliberately separate (run-scope, T-94). 11 tests incl. immutability + real `newRunPlayer` loadout. | Game Engineer | P0       | GDD §5.3          | DONE |
| T-91  | ~~Dominant Trait unlock detection (3+ same family)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-29.** `unlockedDominantTraits(owned)` in `core/mutation/dominant.ts` returns the traits unlocked by owning ≥3 of a family (threshold `DOMINANT_TRAIT_THRESHOLD=3`), in ring order. `DOMINANT_TRAITS` catalogs all five (Leviathan Core / Hive Awareness / Fortress Form / Phase Collapse / Combustion Engine) with their GDD §5.5 effect text as the authoritative spec. Detection + catalog only at first; **combat effects partly wired 2026-05-29** — active families are precomputed onto `PlayerState.dominantTraits` (by RunSession on every pick) and read by the engine: **Fortress Form** (+10 effective RES) and **Combustion Engine** (+2 effective max AP *and* Burn on every damaging player attack/ability) are live + tested. **Leviathan Core** (+30 HP / 20% Abyssal lifesteal), **Hive Awareness** (minimap/spore spread), and **Phase Collapse** (per-floor untargetable / double drain) remain deferred — they need effective-maxHp plumbing, ability-family tags, or UI. 7 detection tests + 6 combat-effect tests (effective-stats + mutation-combat). | Game Engineer | P0       | GDD §5.5          | DONE — detection + Fortress/Combustion effects live; Leviathan/Hive/Phase deferred |
| T-92  | ~~Hybrid Synergy detection (10 cross-family combinations)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-29.** `unlockedSynergies(owned)` in `core/mutation/synergy.ts` returns the synergies active when the player owns ≥1 mutation in each of the two families. `HYBRID_SYNERGIES` catalogs all C(5,2)=10 cross-family pairs — the 5 named in GDD §5.6 (`canon: true`: Bioluminescent Bloom, Pressure Crystal, Fever Spores, Void Shard, Dark Combustion) + 5 studio-authored to complete the set (`canon: false`; the §5.6 "Appendix A" list isn't in our GDD md — flagged for a writer pass). Pairs stored canonically in ring order; `synergyFor(a,b)` is order-independent. Detection + catalog only — combat-effect wiring deferred. 8 tests. | Game Engineer | P1       | GDD §5.6          | DONE — 5 canon + 5 authored; effects-wiring deferred |
| T-93  | ~~VEIN Intermission trigger (4 mutations max → +100 VC instead)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-29.** `resolveStrandEvent(mutationCount)` in `core/mutation/intermission.ts` is the gate the Strand-Event flow consults before drawing: below `MUTATION_CAP=4` → `{kind:'draw'}`; at/above the cap → `{kind:'intermission', veinCrystals: 100}` (no card, flat +100 VC, LACE saturation line — UFD S071). `isMutationCapped(count)` helper. 4 tests. | Game Engineer | P1       | GDD §3.5, §4.2    | DONE |
| T-94  | ~~SIG cap 40 enforcement; LACE event mutation grants only +5 SIG~~ — **DONE 2026-05-29.** `core/mutation/sig.ts` pure value helpers: `accumulateSig(sig, bonus)` clamps to `[0, SIG_CAP=40]`; `sigBonusFor(mutation, source)` returns the mutation's own `sigBonus` for `'strand'` but a flat `LACE_EVENT_SIG_BONUS=5` for `'lace_event'` (Patch 11 — free LACE-room mutations are worth less SIG); `gainMutationSig` composes the two. SIG lives at run scope (the run loop threads the total), not on PlayerState. The canonical 3-Strand + 1-LACE run reaches 35, under the 40 cap. 8 tests. | Game Engineer | P1       | GDD §4.2          | DONE — Patch 11 fix |
| T-95  | ~~Vitest: every modifier type, every family weighting, no-repeat~~ — **DONE 2026-05-29.** `core/mutation/mutation-engine.test.ts` — the cross-cutting sweep over the **real shipped content** (loads all 25 mutations through the T-83 loader, not fixtures): asserts the pool exercises every modifier kind (stat/maxHp/maxAp) + both passive & ability cards; `applyMutation` yields a valid `PlayerState` for all 25; every family is reachable in the draw + weights sum to 100; draws never repeat (no owned, no within-offer dup) across 500 seeds; a full draw→reroll→draw lifecycle is deterministic and dup-free; a capped run converts Strand Events to VEIN Intermissions at 4 mutations with SIG ≤ 40; dominant + synergy detection stay consistent with ownership. 8 integration tests (S-3.4 total: **92** across 12 files). Full suite 534 green; typecheck/lint/web-build clean. | QA            | P0       | TDD §16.1         | DONE |

Rarity multipliers reuse the workbook "Mutation Costs" scale (common 1 / uncommon 2.5 / rare 6 / legendary 15) so item + upgrade economies stay coherent; base + per-zone growth (`1+(zone−1)·0.5`) authored vs ~150-VEIN/floor income (no item-price tab in the sheet — flagged). `zoneForFloor` (6 floors/zone from Drop Rates) + `dispenserPriceForFloor`.

| T-110 | ~~VEIN banked on combat clear~~ — **DONE 2026-05-30.** `RunSession.endEncounter` now banks VEIN on every win: each fallen enemy pays out `veinForKill(tier)` (tier resolved via the `EnemyRegistry`), and the ambient per-floor loot constant (`FLOOR_VEIN_CONSTANT=50`) banks once the floor's boss falls. Defeats bank nothing; balance persists through save/restore (uses the existing v2 `veinCrystals` field, no schema change). 5 tests. | Game Engineer | P0 | GDD §9, Econ E | DONE |
| T-111 | ~~In-run XP & leveling wired into the run loop~~ — **DONE 2026-05-30.** `RunSession` now tracks `xp` + `pendingStatPoints` (save v3; older saves default to 0). Fallen enemies grant XP by tier via authored `XP_PER_KILL` (grunt 12 / elite 40 / boss 200, in `economy/xp.ts`, tuned to GDD §4.3's ~1 level/floor and flagged). `grantXp` applies level-ups across the real curve: +10 HP (max & current) and +1 banked stat point per level crossed, clamped at the run cap. `allocateStatPoint(stat)` spends a point onto str/res/agi/int. Snapshot exposes `xp`/`level`/`pendingStatPoints`; all persist through save/restore (level re-derives). 7 tests. | Game Engineer | P0 | GDD §4.3, Econ E | DONE |

Note: floor-gen does not yet emit merchant rooms (separate task); slot-limit enforcement (GDD §7) deferred to the inventory layer. 6 tests. | Game Engineer | P1 | GDD §10.3, Econ E | DONE |

| T-111 | ~~`MetaState` interface (codex, Sigma Strains, achievements, lifetime stats, cosmetics)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `MetaState` + `LifetimeStats` in `@shared-types/meta-state` (codex/sigma/achievement/cosmetic id sets + lifetime counters; no PII). `core/save/meta-save.ts`: `newMetaState`, serialize/deserialize reusing the generic migration chain, `metaCodec` for SaveManager persistence; `meta-progression.ts` `recordRunOutcome` folds a finished run into the profile (runs/wins/deepest-floor/kills/playtime + codex/achievement union). `core/save/index.ts` barrel ties the layer together. 10 tests. | Game Engineer | P0 | TDD §4.2 | DONE — NFR P8 |
| T-112 | ~~Atomic write pattern: write to temp → rename~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `SaveManager` (`core/save/save-manager.ts`) emulates write-temp→rename over key/value storage with a commit pointer: write the new generation slot, *then* update the head pointer; a crash between the two leaves head on the prior intact generation. 6 tests (incl. a half-written-no-commit case). | Game Engineer | P0       | TDD §5.5, T5     | DONE — NFR P8 |
| T-113 | ~~Keep last 3 save generations (rotation)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `SaveManager` rotates round-robin through 3 generation slots; `loadRun` returns the newest and falls back to older generations when the newest is corrupt (tested: corrupt-newest recovery). | Game Engineer | P0       | TDD §5.5, T5     | DONE — NFR P8 |
| T-114 | Save-on-action hook in turn engine — **PARTIAL 2026-05-28.** `SaveManager` generalised over a `SaveCodec<T>`; `RunSession.toSave()`/`applySave()` + `runSessionCodec` + `restoreRunSession` persist/rebuild a whole run (the floor regenerates from the seed, so a save is just seed + position + cleared set + player). Resume granularity is per-room (an in-combat save resumes as exploring at that room); full save-every-turn mid-combat persistence is the remaining piece. Scene wiring next. 13 save-layer tests. | Game Engineer | P0       | TDD §5.5         | PARTIAL |
| T-115 | ~~Migration framework~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** Generic version-chained migration in `core/save/run-save.ts` (`migrate()` walks `schemaVersion` upward through registered steps); reused by both run-save and meta-save. (git `d9748f6`) Note: landed under `core/save/` rather than `core/turn-engine/migrations/` — co-located with the codecs that use it. | Game Engineer | P1       | TDD §5.6         | DONE |
| T-116 | ~~Vitest: fixture-save migration tests for every prior schemaVersion~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `core/save/run-save.test.ts` exercises the migration chain (current-version round-trip + an older-version fixture migrated forward + unknown-future-version rejection). (git `d9748f6`) | QA            | P1       | TDD §5.6         | DONE |
| T-117 | Resume Run? modal trigger logic (S100) — **PARTIAL 2026-05-28.** RunSandboxScene now auto-resumes a saved run on boot (loads via `SaveManager` + `createWebStorageAdapter`, rebuilds the session, surfaces a "you came back" LACE line); persists at every room boundary and clears the save on victory/defeat; REPLAY/REROLL overwrite with a fresh run. The proper S100 "Resume Run?" choice modal (resume vs discard) is the remaining UI piece. | Game Engineer | P0       | UFD S100, E011   | PARTIAL |

#### Sprite-asset delivery tracker (T-151/152/153)

Per-key art status — source: **Kenney Roguelike/RPG pack** (CC0), sliced via
`tools/tilesheet.cjs` from `apps/game/art/tilesheet-source.png` per
`apps/game/art/sprite-map.json`. ✅ = real PNG shipped; ⬜ = geometry fallback
(still renders, just placeholder). Full spec per key in `docs/SPRITES.md`.

| Group | Keys | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Entities** (7) | `player`, `filterer`, `cave_crawler`, `acid_spitter`, `scavenger`, `shell_brute`, `pressure_warden` | ✅ **7/7** (2026-05-30) — `shell_brute`/`pressure_warden` are weak placeholders, flagged for a swap |
| **Tiles** (6) | `tile_open/wall/hazard/cover/elevated/corruption` | ⬜ 0/6 — pending (sheet terrain is light-themed; may keep dark geometric tiles) |
| **Room icons** (7) | `room_combat/loot/safe/merchant/trap/lace_event/boss` | ⬜ 0/7 — pending |
| **Ability icons** (2) | `pressure_lance`, `rupture` | ⬜ 0/2 — pending |
| **Item icons** (15) | heals/grenades/status/passives (see `docs/SPRITES.md`) | ⬜ 0/15 — pending (text labels work meanwhile) |

**Delivered: 7 / 37.** Next batch (by payoff): tiles → room icons → ability/item icons.

### S-4.7 — Strand Event scenes (UFD Scope 4)

> **Run-loop integration landed 2026-05-29 (core side).** `RunSession` now drives Strand Events end-to-end: clearing a qualifying floor's boss (every Nth floor; off entirely when no mutation pool is supplied, so prior tests/balance are unchanged) transitions to a new `strand_event` status. `beginStrandEvent()` returns a card draw or a VEIN Intermission (at the 4-mutation cap); `strandOffer`, `rerollStrandCard()`, `chooseStrandMutation()` (applies the mutation + accrues SIG), and `acceptIntermission()` complete it → `floor_complete` → `descend()`. Run-scoped **SIG + VEIN Crystals** added to the snapshot and persisted (save schema v2; v1 saves load with both defaulting to 0). The offer is deterministic from seed+floor and regenerates on resume. 9 new run-session tests. The rows below are the *scene UI* on top of this.

## E-7 — Content Pipeline

**Scope:** JSON schemas + validators + actual content authoring at three build orders (Prototype / Alpha / Soft launch).

### S-7.1 — Schemas & validators

| ID    | Title                                                  | Role     | Priority | Refs       | Notes |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | -------- | ---------- | ----- |
| T-282 | Mutation schema                                        | Game Engineer | P0 | TDD §8.1   | |
| T-283 | ~~Enemy schema~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `EnemyDef` schema in `@shared-types/enemy` (schemaVersion, id, name, tier `grunt\|elite\|boss`, zone, maxHp, EntityStats, damageType, aestheticTags) + `parseEnemyDef(input)` loader in `apps/game/src/core/content/enemy-loader.ts` — discriminated-union, never-throws, mirrors the floor-template loader (T-70). Shared content-loader plumbing (error model + predicates + field readers) extracted to `core/content/validation.ts` for reuse by the item loader (T-284) and beyond. Runtime `EnemyState` is instantiated from a def at encounter start; per-floor stat scaling deferred to T-78. 10 tests (happy path, JSON-string input, all error codes, stats-block validation, enum rejection). | Game Engineer | P0 | GDD §8     | DONE |
| T-284 | ~~Item schema~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** Extended `ItemDef` in `@shared-types/item` with `name` + `rarity` (`ItemRarity` = common/uncommon/rare/legendary) and added `parseItemDef(input)` in `core/content/item-loader.ts`. Loader validates the on-disk `schemaVersion` then **strips** it — schemaVersion is a file-format concern, not part of the inventory/save shape (NFR P8), unlike `EnemyDef` which is pure content and keeps it. Validates effect against category (consumables require a valid `heal`/`damage`/`applyStatus` effect with bounded amounts + enum damage/status; passive/equipment must be null). Updated the existing turn-engine item/perf/determinism fixtures for the two new fields. 9 tests. Full suite green at 295. | Game Engineer | P0 | GDD §9     | DONE |
| T-285 | Floor template schema                                  | Game Engineer | P0 | TDD §7.1   | |
| T-286 | LACE line schema                                       | Game Engineer | P0 | TDD §9.2   | |
| T-287 | Organism name table schemas (prefix/trait/suffix)      | Game Engineer | P1 | UFD §3     | |
| T-288 | ~~Cross-reference validator (mutation IDs in floors exist, etc.)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** `crossReferenceContent({enemies, items, floors})` in `core/content/cross-reference.ts` — pure + total (reports all problems): every floor `enemyPool`/`bossId` resolves to a real enemy, `bossId` is boss-tier, enemy/item ids unique. **Wired the real `pnpm validate` gate**, replacing the echo stub: root `validate` → `@helix/game validate:content` → `content-bundle.test.ts`, which loads every shipped enemy/item/floor file through its schema loader then cross-references the bundle. Runs in `pnpm test` too. content README + content-package script updated. 6 unit tests + 4 bundle-gate tests. (Mutation/LACE/organism-name schemas T-282/T-286/T-287 still pending — added to the bundle when they land.) Full suite 311 green. | DevOps | P0 | TDD §14.1 | DONE |

### S-7.2 — Prototype subset content (Gate 1)

| ID    | Title                                                  | Role     | Priority | Refs       | Notes |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | -------- | ---------- | ----- |
| T-289 | ~~5 Minor mutations per family × 5 families = 25 mutations~~ — **DONE 2026-05-29.** 25 Minor `MutationDef` JSON files in `packages/content/mutations/`, **5 per family** across all five families (abyssal/mycelial/lithic/voidborn/thermal). Each themed to its family's playstyle (GDD §5.2): Abyssal = res/maxHp + pressure/crushed; Mycelial = int/maxHp + spore/infected/rooted/regen; Lithic = res + seismic/fractured/crushed burst; Voidborn = agi/int + void/phased/suppressed; Thermal = agi/str/maxAp + thermal/burn. Mix of passive-only and ability-granting cards; every one carries authored LACE commentary. All load through the T-83 loader and pass the `pnpm validate` cross-reference gate (id-unique). This is the live draw pool for the Strand Event engine (T-85–T-95). | Director | P0 | GDD App A  | DONE — first Strand Event candidates |
| T-290 | ~~Zone 1 enemies (5 + 1 boss)~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** Six `EnemyDef` JSON files in `packages/content/enemies/`: `filterer`, `cave_crawler`, `acid_spitter`, `scavenger` (the four `floor_01.json` pools) + `shell_brute` (elite) + `pressure_warden` (boss, matches `floor_01` bossId). All zone `shallows`, balanced grunt/elite/boss stat bands. `enemies.content.test.ts` loads every shipped file through the T-283 loader (so malformed content fails CI) and asserts the roster + id-matches-filename + single boss. 3 tests. | Director | P0       | GDD §8.3   | DONE |
| T-291 | Zone 1 floor templates (Floors 1–5)                    | Director | P0       | GDD §7.1   | |
| T-292 | ~~~15 Common-tier items~~ — **DONE 2026-05-28.** 15 Common `ItemDef` JSON files in `packages/content/items/`: 3 heals (vein_serum, minor_patch, deep_tonic), 5 damage grenades (frag/thermal/acid/concussion/void), 4 status consumables (spore_bomb infected, flare burn, snare_net rooted, emp_pulse suppressed), 3 passives (depth_gauge, chitin_plate, reflex_booster). `items.content.test.ts` loads every file through the T-284 loader, asserts ≥15 items, id-matches-filename, all Common, and coverage of every effect kind (heal/damage/applyStatus/null). 3 tests. | Director | P0       | GDD §9.2   | DONE |
| T-293 | Floor 0 tutorial template (4 rooms)                    | Director | P0       | TDD §21 Q4 | |

## Cross-Epic Dependency Highlights

| Dependency                                          | Implication                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| T-7 (lock title) blocks T-41, T-42, T-45            | App Store account names + domain can't be finalized until trademark is clear                 |
| T-8/T-9 (age rating dry-run) blocks T-407           | TestFlight rating submission needs the questionnaire pre-flighted                            |
| E-3 (core) blocks E-4 (scenes)                      | Scenes can't be wired until the simulation produces stable RunState shapes                   |
| T-30 (determinism CI) blocks every E-3 merge        | Determinism gate must exist before turn-engine work goes through PR review                   |
| T-282–T-288 (schemas) block all content authoring   | Content authors need stable schemas before writing JSON                                      |
| T-289–T-294 (Prototype content) blocks Gate 1       | Without 25 mutations + 1 zone of enemies + Floor 0, the vertical slice can't be tested       |
| E-7 / E-8 content tasks block Gate-N transitions    | Each gate has its own content build order — see GDD §21 and Patch 12                         |
| T-407 (TestFlight rating submission) blocks E-13    | If rating returns >12+, GDD §1.5 and §1.6 need revisiting before launch ops scale up         |
| T-323 (writer contract) is parallel to T-313–T-315  | Director templated fragments ship regardless; writer is upgrade path (DR-004)                |

## Items Explicitly NOT in This Plan (Deferred Per Docs)

Per UFD §11 and GDD scope discipline — these are intentionally **not** broken into tasks at this stage:

- Web demo-specific UI screens beyond what TDD §21 Q5 specifies (Floors 1–2 only)
- Leaderboard detail screens (minimal in v1; expanded in Season 1)
- Friend system (not in v1)
- In-app event teasers (LiveOps content; Phase 5 work)
- Recovery phrase UX (deferred per TDD §11.1 / §10.1 to Season 2+)
- Season pass progression UI (no Season 1 at launch)
- Voice acting (Season 2 target — T-326/T-327 placeholders only)
- Localization beyond English (i18n architecture present; only `en` populated)

| 3 | All P0 tasks are Phase-1/Phase-2 work; P1 = Alpha; P2 = Soft launch; P3 = Global; P4 = Post-launch | Confirmed by GDD §21.1 schedule                      |
| 4 | Sub-tasks added later during sprint planning when individual tasks need decomposition            | Sprint-planning convention; this plan is the backbone |
| 5 | Story-point estimates added in a follow-up pass via `sa-toolkit:task-estimate`                   | Run that skill next if estimates are wanted          |
| 6 | Writer contract closes in Month 4–6; templated assembly is the default ship path                 | DR-004                                               |
| 7 | All Capacitor community plugins remain maintained through 18-month dev window                    | Monitor; alternate plugins identified as fallback if a plugin is abandoned |
| 8 | Branch.io free tier (≤10K MAU) covers attribution through soft launch                            | TDD §2.3; revisit if MAU approaches 10K              |

## Recommended Next Actions

1. **Provision an issue tracker** (Jira personal workspace or ADO) and confirm hierarchy mapping.
2. **Import this list** — task names and descriptions are intentionally written to round-trip cleanly to CSV/JSON.
3. **Run `/task-estimate`** from `sa-toolkit` for story-point estimates if useful for sprint planning.
4. **Execute the trademark search (T-1..T-7) in week 1** so that T-7 unblocks T-41 / T-42 / T-45 before Phase 2 begins.
5. **Kick off Phase 2 prototype work** once E-1 closeout items are done — the Phase 2 backlog starts at T-20 (repo bootstrap) and runs through ~T-300 (Alpha content) over Months 2–11.
